# Project Euler Questions

These are my solutions to the questions posed on the [Project Euler website.](http://www.projecteuler.com)

## Question #1: Multiples of 3 and 5
**Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.**

*The trick here was avoiding using numbers like 15, 30, 45, etc. that are multiples of both 3 and 5.*

## Question #2: Even Fibbonacci numbers
**By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.**

*The next number in the Fibbonacci sequence is derived by adding the previous number to the current one. Starting with 1,2 the third number would be 3 (1+2), the fourth would be 5 (3+2). The first ten numbers in the sequence then would be 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.*
